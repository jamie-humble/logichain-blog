          <h1 class="display-5">Early Senior School</h1>
          <p>
            Over my time in senior school, my knowledge and experience within the broad field of IT has changed dramatically, from year 9 when we made blank, un-elegant websites to then year 10, making full fledged javascript games (in pure JS from memory). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The jump in experience from year 9 to year 10 was huge, straying from the boring markup of HTML and CSS to a huge logic system for a web game. Although the code was not necessarily elegant, it was functional and it made for not only a great finished product but a fantastic gateway which birthed my love for programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are interested, I have created a github pages repo so that you can play the game in your browser <a src="https://jamie-humble.github.io/The-Farmther/">here</a>.
          </p>
          <h1 class="display-5">Year 11</h1>
          <p>
            Year 11 was a good year for IT in the nature of the assessments, firstly, we made arduino guided robot carts to navigate through a maze, but sadly i was not motivated enough to prioritize IT at the time, nor were the robot cars very reliable, nor did i have the experience to create something to be especially proud of. 
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the next assessment was based on creating PHP web pages to communicate with MySQL databases about collections of random items, I spent hours upon hours handcrafting web pages with CSS (before I knew what bootstrap was). 
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during this time that my love-hate relationship with frontend development was born, I loved making these beautiful web pages that I could happily pour my soul into to craft something to be proud of, yet nowadays i hate how boring markup can be sometimes; but I assure you, I love frontend more than I hate it by a wide margin (: auto !important;).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I didn't have any opportunities to continue learning python in class, I subscribed to an email service which sends daily coding problems which are asked in interviews at companies like Google, Uber and LinkedIn. For about 200 days in a row, I completed these problems to develop my programming skills and experience and by the time I stopped doing them, I had made huge progress in my problem solving skills, problem identifying skills, my logical and creative abilities had completely evolved.
          </p>
          <h1 class="display-5">Year 12</h1>
          <p>
            Coming into year 12, I was not too sure how the year for IT was going to go, however I already knew that I wanted to pursue a career in IT; we found out that our old IT teacher was resigning from our school and that we were going to get a new IT teacher. Little did i know that this new teacher would enable me to properly engage with IT as a subject, using this passion that I'd been accruing for the last two years I joined the computer science course that he offered us and since then, I have been putting my best effort in, growing as a person and quickly advancing in experience and knowledge as a result of my efforts. 
          </p>
          <p>
            From handing in a five thousand word essay on hashing algorithms, to coding my own blockchain, to now creating the best piece of work I have ever crafted in the form of none other than LogiChain. On top of this, our new teacher has opened us up to countless opportunities in the form of coding competitions and even scholarships. These coding competitions have all been invaluable in terms of experience working with team members towards deadlines and working under the pressure of time to create programs. Both of which are very useful skill sets coming into the working world, as some programming positions require you to complete a coding question in an interview, and obviously experience working with teams will be useful in the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of my evolution of discipline in IT, I have grown not only in my technical ability but I have grown as a person as a result of my dedication to the discipline of IT as a whole. i'm very grateful for the role models that have driven me in my journey and i'm grateful to myself for the time and dedication that I've put into evolving myself. If I hadn't spent those 200 odd days doing daily coding problems, I don't think I would be where I am right now, I know I certainly would not have been able to execute this project to the level that I have.

          <h1 class="display-5">Prototype</h1>
          <p>
            The development process of LogiChain is something I am very proud of, over the past semester I have held nothing back in terms of effort, starting with project documentation, I spent extra time creating technical documents and progress tracking documentation. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I was finished creating this documentation, I began work on the LogiChain prototype, which I documented through blog posts and regular progress updates for every session of work. The development of the prototype was not only well documented but the project files were well organized and up to date, I used google drive to sync my laptop’s local files with my project on google drive.
          </p>
          <h1 class="display-5">Final Project</h1>
          <p>
            Once the prototype was finished, I began working on the final LogiChain before the start of the holidays, at this point I decided to improve the project organization even further. 
            I used Atlassian’s Jira dashboard app to track the progress of the project’s individual tasks, I did some restructuring of the google drive directory and I hosted this blog on github pages instead of a 3rd party hosting service.            
          </p>
          <p>
            I then began work on the final product of LogiChain, including making a brand new look for the landing page, using a google powered database instead of local JSON files and most importantly a upgraded asset flow for users and an upgraded order system.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would say that the idea to create such a prototype for LogiChain was a very beneficial idea, it has allowed me to refactor the app as a whole, making for an incredibly polished final product, in the exact same image that I first imagined LogiChain in.
